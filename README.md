# Exercises from The Little Schemer

In reading [The Little Schemer](https://books.google.com/books?id=xyO-KLexVnMC&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20little%20schemer&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=the%20little%20schemer&f=false) I thought it'd be a good idea to go through some of the exercises. This repository is entirely my work written up as I go through the book.

As much as possible, I'm attempting to compose the functions before looking at the answer. That said, I don't promise to commit the mistakes I make. On the other hand, I don't promise to get it exactly the same as the book, either. If this work is useful to you, thank the authors of the aforementioned book.
